       <h4>Here are some instructions on how to play our Concentration Game:</h4>

       <p id="instructions">
         0. Foremost, make sure you are 1) logged in and 2) you have made a deck of cards (i.e. your terms and their hints)<br>
         1. Select a board configuration from the drop down menu. This specifies the size (meaning number of cards) in your deck to play.<br>
         2. Select a card background. Instead of plain white, there are several other options for you to choose from.<br>
         3. Then, press play. You'll see your cards populate on the screen.<br>
         4. Look over the information displayed on the cards. Once you find two that you think match, click on each one. You will see them turn yellow to indicate that they are selected. Then, the cards will rotate, to show you the term that is on the back. You can then see if you selected two matching cards, or learn what the correct term is that matches the clue on the front. When you select matching cards, you will hear a tone indicating that you selected a correct match, and when you select two unmatching cards, a different tone will play.<br>
         5. The goal is to clear the board of all of the cards.<br>
         6. The "Hint" button can be pressed to clear two matching cards from the board, but this will lower your score.<br>
         7. The "Solve" button currently clears the entire board, but also drastically lowers your score.<br>
         8. Finally, if you'd like to restart for any reason, such as to change the board configuration or style, you can press the "Restart" button to reselect those options and begin playing from the beginning.
