Pseudocode for Concentration.js
===============================
Assumptions:
------------
-Each term object has field properties which include an id, label/name, and hint(s)
-Term refers to the object/thing that has a name and hints. The hints for terms are the things that are displayed on each card. The name of the term is not immediately visible to the player.
-Cards only display hints from specific terms. Internally each card has a parent id/answer field that refers back to the term that the card's hint originated from.

Create terms and hints for cards:
---------------------------------
num = # of cards
terms[] = chooseFromTerms(num/2)	//chose num/2 terms from the term list
for(every 2 cards)			//card0 and card1 are neighboring cards
 card0.hint = terms[i].chooseHint()	//pick a hint from the term in pos i
 card0.ans   = terms[i].id
 card1.hint = terms[i].chooseHint()	//pick a different hint from term in pos i
 card1.ans   = terms[i].id
shuffleCards()

Make cards matchable and clearable, Add Move Counter:
-----------------------------------------------------
moveCount = 0
selectToggle = false			//toggles whether to set id0 or id1
ans0 = null  ,  ans1 = null		//answer to each card selected
hint0 = null , hint1 = null		//hint to each card selected
onCardClick()				//when a card is clicked on...
 if(!selectToggle)
 	ans0 = this.ans
  	hint0 = this.hint
  	selectToggle = !selectToggle
 else 
  	ans1 = this.ans
  	hint1 = this.hint
  	selectToggle = !selectToggle
	moveCount++
  	if(hint0!=hint1)		//only check for match if different cards
		if(ans0==ans1)		//if cards have the same answer...
			//Show match signal
			removeCard0()
			removeCard1()
		else
			shuffleHintCard0()
			shuffleHintCard1()
