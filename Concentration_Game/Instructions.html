       <h4>Here are some instructions on how to play our Concentration Game:</h4>
       <p id="instructions">
         Foremost, make sure you are 1) logged in and 2) you have made a deck of cards (i.e. your terms and their hints)<br>
         <br><strong>Playing the game:</strong><br>
         1. Select a board configuration from the drop down menu. This specifies the size (meaning number of cards) in your deck to play.<br>
         2. Select a card background. Instead of plain white, there are several other options for you to choose from.<br>
         3. Then, press play. You'll see your cards populate on the screen.<br>
         4. Look over the information displayed on the cards. Once you find two that you think match, click on each one. You will see them turn yellow to indicate that they are selected. Then, the cards will rotate, to show you the term that is on the back. You can then see if you selected two matching cards, or learn what the correct term is that matches the clue on the front. When you select matching cards, you will hear a tone indicating that you selected a correct match, and when you select two unmatching cards, a different tone will play.<br>
