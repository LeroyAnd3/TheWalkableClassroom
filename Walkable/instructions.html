	<div class="instrBox">

		1. Select from the drop down menu a board configuration that you would like.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/background.png"></img>
		2. Select from the drop down menu the card background that you would like.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/category.png"></img>
		3. Select from the drop down a category for your game.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/play.png"></img>
		4. Press Play to begin game play!
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/gameBoard.png"></img>
		5. This is an example game board. Scroll down in your screen to make sure you can see your gameboard fully.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/cardSelect.png"></img>
		6. Once you have your board setup however you like, click on a card. It will become highlighted yellow when you select it (as show by the blue circled card). Note the orange circled card for future instructions.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/flippedCard.png"></img>
		7. When you select two cards, they both highlight yellow, and then rotate to show you the hints on the back. As you can see, these two cards no longer have the hints on the cards as the previous image. That is because they have rotated to show the terms on the backside of the card. This is to help you learn what the hints on the front actually represent. (aka the answers that match to the hints)
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/newHints.png"></img>
		8. Notice that the hints are now different. The cards are still here because the two cards that were selected were an incorrect match. If you select an incorrect pair of cards, then new hints will appear, if you make multiple hints for a term, and the hints will be randomly shuffled through.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/correct.png"></img>
		9. If you select two cards that are a correct match, the cards will disappear as shown here.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/win.png"></img>
		Note: The goal is to clear the board by matching all the pairs of cards correctly. If you clear the board, you "win" and this is what is seen.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/hint.png"></img>
		Note: Pressing the HINT button will clear one pair of cards from the deck.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/solve.png"></img>
		Note: Pressing the SOLVE button will clear all of the cards from the deck.
	</div>

	<div class="instrBox">
		<img src="./resources/quit.png"></img>
		Note: Pressing the QUIT button will refresh the page and allow you to reselect board configurations.
	</div>
